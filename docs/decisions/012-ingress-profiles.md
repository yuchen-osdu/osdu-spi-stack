# ADR-012: Three Ingress Profiles (azure, dns, ip)

## Context

The SPI Stack has three distinct ingress audiences:

- **Fresh developer spin-up on a personal Azure subscription.** No DNS zone, no registered domain, wants a browsable URL fast.
- **A team running against an owned Azure DNS zone.** Needs per-service hostnames (osdu, kibana, airflow), real TLS certificates, and DNS records managed as workloads rotate.
- **A smoke test or skills harness.** Wants to reach an OSDU API by IP and does not care about TLS at all.

Gateway API plus managed Istio (from ADR-002) can serve all three, but the surrounding glue is materially different per mode: ACME issuers only exist where there is a hostname; ExternalDNS only makes sense where there is a zone to manage; the Gateway's HTTPS listener either has one certificate (single host) or three (multi-host).

Picking one of these at install time keeps the declared topology simple and avoids surprising partial configurations.

## Decision

Three ingress profiles, each a self-contained Flux Kustomization tree under `software/stacks/osdu/ingress/<mode>/`. The mode is selected by `--ingress-mode` on `spi up` (env var `SPI_INGRESS_MODE`, default `azure`) and plumbed into `infra/flux.bicep` as a parameter; the AKS Flux extension's `ingress` Kustomization points at the chosen path.

| Mode | Hostname source | TLS | DNS management | Use case |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `azure` (default) | Azure-assigned `<label>.<region>.cloudapp.azure.com` | Let's Encrypt HTTP-01, single-host overlay | none | Dev spin-up; zero config |
| `dns` | `*.<user-zone>` (osdu, kibana, airflow subdomains) | Let's Encrypt HTTP-01, multi-host overlay | ExternalDNS to Azure DNS Zone | Team environments on an owned zone |
| `ip` | bare ingress IP | none | none | Smoke tests, skills, debugging |

Shared pieces (the cert-manager install and the Gateway base component) live under `software/components/`. The selected ingress tree is the Gateway's sole Flux owner (ADR-025), and every mode binds the Gateway to the AKS add-on's external ingress Service rather than deploying its own LoadBalancer (ADR-026). The profile owns the variable surface:

- `azure` applies the `azure-dns-label-name` annotation to the add-on's ingress Service via Flux (ADR-026), pinning an Azure FQDN; cert-manager issues one cert against that FQDN; Kibana is served under `/kibana` via a subpath overlay.
- `dns` provisions a second UAMI (`<cluster>-external-dns`, scoped `DNS Zone Contributor` on the target DNS zone, ADR-005). ExternalDNS reads HTTPRoute hostnames and writes A and TXT records. The Gateway has one HTTPS listener per hostname, each with its own certificate. Kibana is its own subdomain (no subpath).
- `ip` is the minimum surface: HTTPRoutes without hostnames bound to the HTTP:80 listener. No cert-manager issuers, no ExternalDNS, no Kibana routing, no TLS overlay.

Inputs per mode land in a single `spi-ingress-config` ConfigMap in `osdu-flux` (ADR-019), consumed by Flux `postBuild.substituteFrom`.

The ownership rule is invariant across modes: exactly one child Kustomization
named `spi-gateway-tls` applies `Gateway/aks-istio-ingress/spi-gateway`. TLS
modes render the base plus certificates and HTTPS listeners; `ip` renders the
HTTP base only.

Each mode has a `<mode>-minimal` sibling tree, selected when the stack profile is `minimal` (ADR-021). It is the mode's tree minus the `spi-osdu-routes` Kustomization, whose `dependsOn: spi-osdu-services` cannot be satisfied by a profile that deploys no OSDU services. HTTPRoutes are split by scope for this reason: `spi-middleware-routes` (Kibana, Airflow) reconciles in both variants, `spi-osdu-routes` only in the full trees. `ip-minimal` is empty, since `ip` mode carries no middleware routes at all.

`--profile bare` selects the empty `software/stacks/osdu/ingress/bare/` tree for every ingress mode because it deploys no cert-manager or Gateway. No mode can serve traffic on this profile. The CLI rejects explicit `--ingress-mode` and `--dns-zone` options with `bare`; `infra/flux.bicep` routes `bare` to the empty tree before evaluating `ingressMode`.

Rejected:
- **Single mode with conditional Helm or Kustomize overlays.** Produces a profile matrix that is hard to review and makes `what-if` diffs opaque. Three flat profiles are easier to read and swap.
- **Terraform-first DNS for `dns` mode.** ExternalDNS's continuous reconciliation matches HTTPRoute changes as services are added; Terraform drift-reconciles only on apply.
- **Always provision an Azure DNS zone.** Forces users to own a zone they may not have; `azure` mode works against any Azure subscription out of the box.

## Consequences

- Switching modes is a Bicep parameter change plus one Flux reconcile; no hand-edits to Kustomizations.
- Each mode's surface is self-describing. A reader sees the full topology in one `stack.yaml` plus the overlays it references.
- Independent Flux reconcilers never compete for the same Gateway, so an HTTPS profile cannot drift back to HTTP-only between reconciliation intervals.
- `dns` mode introduces a second UAMI and a DNS Zone Contributor role assignment. Both are conditional in `infra/main.bicep` on a non-empty `dnsZoneName` parameter.
- `ip` mode is intentionally low-fidelity; endpoints lose HTTPS and middleware UIs (Kibana, Airflow) are not routed. It is documented as debug-only.
- Adding a fourth mode is adding a fourth subdirectory under `software/stacks/osdu/ingress/` and a fourth enum value; no core Flux surgery.

Existing clusters that predate single ownership require a controlled one-time
migration. Disable pruning on the live Gateway and Certificate, reconcile the
ingress parent so the selected profile adopts them, reconcile the core parent to
remove its obsolete child Kustomization, then restore normal pruning.
