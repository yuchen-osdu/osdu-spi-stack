# Architectural Decision Records (ADRs)

An Architectural Decision (AD) is a justified software design choice that addresses a functional or non-functional requirement that is architecturally significant. An Architectural Decision Record (ADR) captures a single AD and its rationale.

For more information [see](https://adr.github.io/).

## How to Create an ADR

1. Copy `adr-template.md` to `NNNN-title-with-dashes.md`, where NNNN is the next number in sequence.
   - Check for existing PRs so you do not collide on a number.
   - There is also a short-form template `adr-short-template.md` for smaller decisions.
2. Edit `NNNN-title-with-dashes.md`.
   - Status starts as `proposed`.
3. For each considered option, write one line on why it was rejected. The decision is what was chosen; alternatives get just enough space to show the trade-off.
4. Open a PR. The status moves to `accepted` once the decision is agreed.
5. Decisions can be changed later. Reversing or materially changing an accepted decision needs a new ADR that supersedes the old one; do not silently rewrite a closed decision in place. A small additive adjustment that extends a decision without contradicting it (a later profile, flag, or value) may instead be recorded as a short dated amendment note in the existing ADR, since a whole new ADR for a one-line change is disproportionate.

## ADR Style

ADRs record decisions, not engineering logs. Keep them short and forward-facing so a reader can grok the decision in a single pass. The prose style (voice, word list, review checklist) is fixed in [docs/STYLE.md](../STYLE.md); the structural rules below complement it.

- **No `## Validation` sections.** Phase-by-phase acceptance logs belong in the PR description, not in the ADR.
- **Amend only for small additive notes; supersede for real changes.** A decision that is reversed or materially changed gets a new ADR that supersedes it, not a rewrite of the closed record. A minor additive extension that does not contradict the decision (for example a later profile that reuses the same pattern) may be captured as a brief dated amendment note, a line or two, in place rather than a full new ADR.
- **No incident narrative in Context.** State the structural problem the decision addresses. Specific clusters, timeout values, and triggering incidents age poorly inside the ADR.
- **One-line option rejections.** Write "Rejected: <one clause>" rather than paragraphs re-litigating prior attempts.
- **Forward-looking, not retrospective.** "Supersedes X because..." is fine; "The previous version of this ADR proposed..." is a sign the ADR should be superseded rather than edited.

## When to Create an ADR

Create an ADR for any decision that could plausibly have gone a different way and where the alternative would be defensible:

- Architecture patterns (deployment strategies, dependency ordering, GitOps boundaries).
- Technology choices (middleware selection, operators, provisioning tools).
- Design patterns (namespace model, credential handling, ingress strategy).
- Security posture (identity model, certificate distribution, admission policy).

## Templates

- **Full template**: [`adr-template.md`](./adr-template.md)
- **Short template**: [`adr-short-template.md`](./adr-short-template.md)
