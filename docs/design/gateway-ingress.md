# Gateway and Ingress

**What this explains.** What `--ingress-mode azure`, `--ingress-mode dns`, and `--ingress-mode ip` provision concretely, how to switch between them on an existing cluster, and how to debug a 404 or a TLS error.

**Why it matters.** Three modes look like three flags but they swap out cert-manager issuers, ExternalDNS, TLS overlays, and HTTPRoute hostnames. Knowing which mode is live tells you which moving parts are wired and which are deliberately absent.

> **Companion docs.** [Bicep architecture](bicep-architecture.md) explains the `external-dns-*` modules and how `--ingress-mode` is plumbed into `infra/flux.bicep`. [Flux reconciliation](flux-reconciliation.md) covers how the `ingress` Kustomization layers on top of the `stack` Kustomization.

## The three modes at a glance

| Mode | Hostname source | TLS | DNS management | Use case |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `azure` (default) | Azure-assigned `<label>.<region>.cloudapp.azure.com` | Let's Encrypt HTTP-01, single-host | none | Dev spin-up, zero-config |
| `dns` | `*.<user-zone>` (osdu, kibana, airflow subdomains) | Let's Encrypt HTTP-01, multi-host | ExternalDNS to Azure DNS Zone | Team environments on an owned zone |
| `ip` | bare ingress IP, no hostname | none | none | Smoke tests, skills, debug |

Each mode is a self-contained Flux Kustomization tree under `software/stacks/osdu/ingress/<mode>/`. The mode is selected by `--ingress-mode` on `spi up` (env var `SPI_INGRESS_MODE`, default `azure`) and plumbed into `infra/flux.bicep` as the `ingress` Kustomization path. See [ADR-012](../decisions/012-ingress-profiles.md).

## Shared pieces (all three modes)

Some pieces are in every mode and live under `software/components/`:

- **Managed Istio** from AKS Automatic (ADR-002). Provides the Gateway API
  implementation and the AKS managed Istio add-on Service
  `aks-istio-ingress/aks-istio-ingressgateway-external`. The stack does not
  render this add-on-owned Service.
- **`Gateway` resource** in the `aks-istio-ingress` namespace. The base manifest under `software/components/gateway/` listens on HTTP:80; the `azure` and `dns` TLS overlays layer their HTTPS listeners on top. The selected ingress profile is its sole Flux renderer, through one `spi-gateway-tls` Kustomization that every non-bare mode declares under that same name: the TLS modes point it at their overlay, `ip` points it at the base component. One name means switching `--ingress-mode` only rewrites `spec.path` instead of pruning one owner and creating another. The legacy stack-profile `spi-gateway` renders nothing and is retained temporarily as a non-pruning ownership handoff (ADR-025).
- **cert-manager** for any mode that issues TLS (`azure`, `dns`).
- **`spi-ingress-config` ConfigMap** in `osdu-flux`, written by the CLI during K8s bootstrap. Carries `GATEWAY_HOSTNAME`, `GATEWAY_LABEL`, `DNS_ZONE`, and similar values consumed by Flux `postBuild.substituteFrom`.

## Mode: `azure` (default)

Two artifacts make this mode work end-to-end:

1. **`azure-dns-label-name` annotation on the Istio ingress LB.** The
   `spi-ingress-dns-label` Kustomization server-side applies the annotation
   onto the add-on's `aks-istio-ingressgateway-external` Service from a
   partial manifest (`software/components/azure-dns-label/`). The write must
   come from Flux: the `aks-managed-protect-system-namespaces` admission
   policy denies every other identity in `aks-istio-ingress`, and the
   node-resource-group deny assignment blocks patching the public IP itself
   (ADR-026). The Azure cloud controller then gives the existing public IP a
   `<label>.<region>.cloudapp.azure.com` FQDN.
2. **Single-host cert-manager `Certificate`.** A `Certificate` for `<label>.<region>.cloudapp.azure.com` issued by a `ClusterIssuer` that uses HTTP-01 against the Gateway. The HTTPS listener referencing the cert Secret is applied at the same time as the HTTP:80 listener that solves the challenge, so the listener simply stays unprogrammed until cert-manager finishes the ACME dance.

Routing in this mode: every OSDU API is reached at `https://<label>.<region>.cloudapp.azure.com/api/<service>/v1/...`. Kibana is served at `https://<label>.<region>.cloudapp.azure.com/kibana` via a subpath overlay. Airflow is not externally routed in this mode (use `kubectl port-forward` if you need its UI).

What `software/stacks/osdu/ingress/azure/` lands:

- `spi-ingress-dns-label`, stamping the DNS label onto the add-on Service
  (non-pruning; the add-on keeps ownership of the Service).
- A `Kustomization` for cert-manager issuers (Let's Encrypt staging + prod).
- `spi-gateway-tls`, rendering
  `software/overlays/gateway-tls-single-host`: the base Gateway bound to the
  add-on Service, the HTTPS listener, and the single-host `Certificate` plus
  its ReferenceGrant.
- HTTPRoutes for every OSDU service path, plus the Kibana subpath route.

This mode requires zero Azure outside the resource group: no DNS zone, no public IP outside the AKS LB, no extra UAMI.

## Mode: `dns`

Two more pieces in addition to `azure`'s setup:

1. **A second UAMI (`<cluster>-external-dns`)** scoped `DNS Zone Contributor` on the DNS zone (the role assignment binds to the zone; the module deploys into the zone's resource group). Provisioned by `infra/modules/external-dns-identity.bicep` and `infra/modules/external-dns-role.bicep`, conditional on a non-empty `dnsZoneName` parameter. The CLI requires `SPI_INGRESS_DNS_ZONE` (or `--dns-zone`) when mode is `dns`.
2. **ExternalDNS deployment** in `software/stacks/osdu/ingress/dns/`. Reads HTTPRoute hostnames and writes A and TXT records to the Azure DNS zone. Pod runs as the second UAMI via Workload Identity.

Hostname layout:

| Subdomain | Serves |
|---|---|
| `osdu.<zone>` | All OSDU service APIs |
| `kibana.<zone>` | Kibana UI |
| `airflow.<zone>` | Airflow UI (when enabled) |

The Gateway has one HTTPS listener per hostname, each with its own `Certificate`. cert-manager handles all three. ExternalDNS sees the HTTPRoute creation and writes the matching A record within ~60 seconds.

What `software/stacks/osdu/ingress/dns/` lands:

- cert-manager issuers (same as `azure`).
- ExternalDNS HelmRelease with the UAMI ServiceAccount.
- `spi-gateway-tls`, rendering `software/overlays/gateway-tls-multi-host`: the base Gateway, three HTTPS listeners, and three `Certificate` resources.
- HTTPRoutes scoped per subdomain.

## Mode: `ip`

Intentionally minimal. The Istio ingress LB has a public IP; no hostname, no cert-manager, no ExternalDNS, no HTTPS.

What `software/stacks/osdu/ingress/ip/` lands:

- `spi-gateway-tls`, rendering `software/components/gateway` unmodified: HTTP:80 and nothing else. The name is shared with the TLS modes so a mode switch keeps one Flux inventory (ADR-025).
- HTTPRoutes bound to that listener with no `hostnames` field.
- No cert issuer.
- No Kibana, no Airflow UI routing (the workloads still exist; you reach them via port-forward).

The CLI documents this as debug-only. You will hit "insecure HTTP" warnings in browsers and have no way to expose Kibana or Airflow without port-forwarding.

## Switching modes on an existing cluster

`--ingress-mode` is a Bicep parameter on `infra/flux.bicep`. Switching is one CLI invocation:

```bash
uv run spi up --env dev1 --ingress-mode dns --dns-zone example.com
```

The CLI:

1. Re-deploys `infra/main.bicep` to materialise `external-dns-identity` and
   `external-dns-role` if needed.
2. Applies the DNS label to the managed ingress Service only when the selected
   mode is `azure`.
3. Re-applies `spi-ingress-config` with the new values.
4. Re-deploys `infra/flux.bicep` with the new `ingressMode` parameter. The
   `fluxConfigurations` resource updates the `ingress` Kustomization path.
5. Reconciles. The shared `spi-gateway-tls` inventory applies the new mode's
   complete Gateway, so switching modes does not prune the Gateway or Service.

`spi info` then shows the new endpoints.

## Worked example: debug a 404 in `azure` mode

You curl `https://<label>.<region>.cloudapp.azure.com/api/partition/v1/partitions/test` and get a 404 from the Gateway.

Five things to check in order:

1. **DNS resolves.** `dig <label>.<region>.cloudapp.azure.com`. If empty, the
   AKS LB Service does not have the DNS label annotation; check
   `kubectl get svc aks-istio-ingressgateway-external -n aks-istio-ingress -o yaml`.
2. **TLS handshake completes.** `curl -vI https://<label>...`. If TLS errors, cert-manager has not issued. `kubectl describe certificate -n platform` shows the ACME state (certs issue into `platform` and reach the Gateway via ReferenceGrant, ADR-022).
3. **The HTTPRoute exists and is accepted.** `kubectl get httproute -n osdu`. The `Accepted` condition should be `True`. If the Gateway rejected it (hostname mismatch), the message tells you which field is wrong.
4. **The backend Service has endpoints.** `kubectl get endpoints -n osdu`. If the service has no ready pods, the 404 is actually a 503 wearing 404 clothing.
5. **The path matches what the service expects.** OSDU APIs live under `/api/<service>/v1/...`. The HTTPRoute is path-prefix-based, not regex, so a typo in the path is a 404.

Most 404s are item 3 or item 5. Item 1 catches mode switches; item 2 catches Let's Encrypt rate limits.

## Worked example: debug a 404 in `dns` mode

Same drill, plus one: **ExternalDNS wrote the A record.** `kubectl logs deploy/external-dns -n foundation | tail` shows what it did. If it has not written anything, the HTTPRoute hostname is not in the form ExternalDNS expects (`<sub>.<zone>` with the zone exactly matching `--dns-zone`).
