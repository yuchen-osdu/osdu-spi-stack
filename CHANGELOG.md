# Changelog

All notable changes to the `spi` CLI are documented here. Versions follow
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/). Release notes for each tag are
also auto-generated from conventional commits and attached to the
corresponding [GitHub Release](https://github.com/Azure/osdu-spi-stack/releases).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- `graduated` deployment profile with Wellbore DDMS, its internal bulk worker,
  profile-specific ingress routes, and worker network/auth policies.
- Profile-aware atomic image resolution; core resolves 13 images and
  graduated resolves the same core set plus the two Wellbore images.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-05-27

### Added
- Per-environment 5-char random suffix on globally unique Azure resource
  names (storage, Key Vault, ACR, Cosmos, Service Bus). Persisted as the
  `spi-name-suffix` tag on the resource group so subsequent runs reuse it;
  legacy (pre-suffix) deployments keep unsuffixed names. (`ee45a65`)
- Cosmos SQL and Gremlin data-plane role assignments for the OSDU managed
  identity; `serviceBusDisableLocalAuth` parameter (default `true`) with
  `minimumTlsVersion: '1.2'` on Service Bus namespaces (ADR-021).
- `system-cosmos-*` Key Vault secrets for system services and a
  per-partition blob record container.
- Kubelet-identity AcrPull grant (`kubeletIdentityObjectId`) and
  `deployerPrincipalType` parameter for human-vs-service-principal
  deployers.
- Opt-in Application Insights + Log Analytics provisioning behind
  `enableApplicationInsights` (ADR-023).
- `availabilityZones` parameter on the system pool (default all three
  zones) for regions with zonal capacity constraints.
- Retry with backoff on OSDU image-tag resolution against the community
  registry.
- Deployment tenant pinned into the kubeconfig exec environment so an
  inherited `AZURE_TENANT_ID` cannot break cluster authentication.
- `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` and `SUPPORT.md`; `CODEOWNERS` and
  `.github/copilot-instructions.md` updated with ownership and deployment
  notes. (`836a623`)
- Prime Copilot skill. (`480a9d8`)

### Changed
- AKS Automatic clusters now require Kubernetes >= 1.36; managed Istio
  pinned to `asm-1-30` (ADR-019).
- SPI-owned GitOps objects (GitRepository, Kustomizations, seed
  ConfigMaps/Secrets, image lock) moved from `flux-system` to the dedicated
  `osdu-flux` namespace; Flux extension multi-tenancy enforcement disabled
  (ADR-020).
- Workload node-placement label renamed `agentpool` -> `spi-pool`
  (ADR-022).
- Default deployment region changed from `eastus2` to `westus3`.
- Chart pins raised: cert-manager `v1.18.*`, trust-manager `v0.22.*`,
  CloudNativePG `0.29.*` (PostgreSQL image pinned to major 17).
- cert-manager leader election moved out of the protected `kube-system`
  namespace.
- Elasticsearch endpoints use the certificate-SAN-valid short service form
  (`elasticsearch-es-http.platform.svc`) and partition records set
  `elastic-ssl-enabled: true`.
- `rich` minimum bumped to `>=15.0.0`. (`72c73cb`)
- `ruff` dev requirement updated. (`0d427ef`)

### Fixed
- `az group create` no longer re-PUTs existing resource groups (which
  cleared the `spi-name-suffix` tag and caused resumed deploys to mint new
  resource names).
- Cluster-admin role-assignment verification uses the ARM REST API
  directly, avoiding Microsoft Graph calls that Conditional Access
  policies can block.
- Istio ASM revision detection reads the istiod deployment name instead of
  a namespace label that AKS does not set.
- Bicep templates are now bundled inside the installed wheel
  (`spi/infra/`) via hatchling `force-include`, with a source-checkout
  fallback in `paths.py`. Earlier wheels resolved `INFRA_ROOT` to a
  nonexistent path under `lib/pythonX.Y/infra/`, breaking `spi up` for
  every `uv tool install` user. (`ee45a65`)
