"""Per-service MR image pins on the live osdu-image-lock ConfigMap.

A pin points one service at the container image built by an OSDU GitLab
merge-request pipeline, resolved from the MR's source branch at its head
commit. Pins live in the lock itself: the service's data keys are
overwritten and provenance (MR iid, branch, canonical image, timestamps)
is recorded in one JSON annotation, so `spi reconcile --refresh-images`
and `spi up` can re-render the lock without silently reverting a pin.
