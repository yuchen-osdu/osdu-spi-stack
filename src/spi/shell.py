"""Command execution and kubectl helpers.

``run_command`` is the transparent front door used whenever an az/kubectl/
flux/helm command should be visible to the operator. ``kubectl_apply_yaml``
retries on transient kube-API errors. ``kubectl_json`` is the silent query
helper used where panel output would be noise: the panels show what the CLI
changes, not what it reads. ``prune_kube_context`` clears the kubeconfig
entries a deleted cluster leaves behind.

Every process the CLI launches goes through ``run_process``. On native Windows, CLIs such as
Azure CLI install as ``.cmd`` batch shims; ``CreateProcess`` cannot run a
batch file, so the OS relaunches it through ``cmd.exe``, which re-parses the
flat command line (``shell=False`` constrains Python, not the OS). For those
shims ``prepare_command`` builds an explicit ``cmd.exe`` command line with
every argument escaped, applying the mitigations published for the
CVE-2024-24576 (BatBadBut) class. Scope: the guarantee holds for standard
``%*``-forwarding shims such as ``az.cmd``. A shim that re-parses its
arguments again (``call``, ``%~1`` re-expansion, ``setlocal
enabledelayedexpansion``) defeats any command-line escaping scheme, and
cmd.exe caps its command line at 8,191 characters where ``CreateProcess``
allows 32,767. Panels printed by ``run_command`` show the logical argv, not
the serialized cmd.exe line.
