# OSDU SPI Stack

**Deploy [OSDU](https://osduforum.org/) to AKS Automatic using Azure-native services.**

SPI Stack provisions Azure infrastructure, bootstraps AKS, and hands application
lifecycle management to Flux GitOps. It gives developers and platform engineers a
reproducible environment for evaluating OSDU on Azure.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> SPI Stack is designed for development, testing, and platform evaluation. It is
> not intended for production deployments.

## Quick Start

### 1. Install

Install [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/), then install the latest SPI Stack release.

**macOS and Linux**

```bash
uv tool install "$(curl -fsSL https://api.github.com/repos/Azure/osdu-spi-stack/releases/latest \
  | grep -o 'https://github.com/Azure/osdu-spi-stack/releases/download/[^"]*-py3-none-any.whl')"
```

**Windows PowerShell**

```powershell
uv tool install (irm https://api.github.com/repos/Azure/osdu-spi-stack/releases/latest).assets.where({ $_.name -like '*-py3-none-any.whl' }).browser_download_url
```

Verify the installation:

```bash
spi --version
```

See [Installation](docs/install.md) for pinned versions, upgrades, and troubleshooting.

### 2. Check prerequisites

Deployment requires `az`, Bicep, `kubectl`, `kubelogin`, Flux, and an Azure subscription
where your identity can create resource groups, deploy the listed Azure services, and
create role assignments.

```bash
spi check
```

### 3. Deploy

```bash
spi up --env dev1

# Core plus the Wellbore DDMS and its internal bulk worker
spi up --env dev1 --profile graduated
```

> [!NOTE]
> A full deployment typically takes 45–50 minutes, dominated by AKS Automatic
> provisioning.

> [!WARNING]
> `spi up` creates billable Azure resources. Cost varies by region, profile,
> partition count, and runtime. Remove the environment when it is no longer needed.

### 4. Inspect and remove

```bash
spi status          # Monitor deployment health
spi info            # View endpoints

# Delete the environment when finished
spi down --env dev1
```

## Why SPI Stack

- **Transparent:** Shows each `az` and `kubectl` command before running it.
- **Azure-native services:** Uses Cosmos DB, Service Bus, Storage, Key Vault, and Entra ID.
- **AKS Automatic:** Includes managed Istio, Karpenter, and Deployment Safeguards.
- **GitOps-driven:** Flux owns in-cluster reconciliation after bootstrap.
- **Secretless authentication:** Workloads access Azure through federated
  Workload Identity.
- **Multi-partition:** Creates isolated Cosmos DB, Service Bus, and Storage resources
  for each OSDU partition.

## Architecture

![SPI Stack architecture](docs/diagrams/architecture.png)

Bicep declares the Azure resources, the `spi` CLI orchestrates provisioning and
cluster bootstrap, and Flux reconciles the Kubernetes workloads from this repository.
OSDU services reach Azure PaaS through Workload Identity; no Azure access keys or
SAS tokens are stored.

See [Architecture](docs/architecture.md) for the control planes, deployment pipeline,
namespace model, and service topology.

## What It Deploys

SPI Stack creates AKS Automatic plus the Azure services required by OSDU: Cosmos DB,
Service Bus, Storage Accounts, Key Vault, Azure Container Registry, and Managed
Identity.

Flux deploys three application namespaces:

| Namespace | Contents |
|-----------|----------|
| `foundation` | ECK, CNPG, cert-manager, and trust-manager |
| `platform` | Elasticsearch, Redis, PostgreSQL, and Airflow |
| `aks-istio-ingress` | AKS-managed Istio Gateway and public LoadBalancer |
| `osdu` | Core OSDU APIs, bootstrap jobs, schema load, and reference services |

### Profiles

| Profile | Deploys | Use when |
|---------|---------|----------|
| `core` (default) | Middleware and OSDU services | Evaluating the full stack |
| `graduated` | Core plus Wellbore DDMS and its internal worker | Wellbore domain workflows |
| `minimal` | Operators and middleware only | Developing or validating the platform layer |
| `bare` | Azure infrastructure and activated GitOps | Iterating on infrastructure, identity, or custom workloads |

See [Stack profiles](docs/architecture.md#stack-profiles) for the exact layer boundaries.

## Deployment Options

The default command creates the `opendes` partition and uses an Azure-assigned
hostname. Common variations include:

```bash
# Multiple OSDU partitions
spi up --env dev1 --partition opendes --partition tenant1

# Hostnames in an existing Azure DNS zone
spi up --env dev1 --ingress-mode dns --dns-zone example.com

# Middleware without OSDU services
spi up --env dev1 --profile minimal

# Resolve a coordinated tag across the configured SPI GHCR fleet
spi up --env dev1 --image-tag v1.2.3

# Validate the same feature ref across service repositories
spi up --env dev1 --image-ref fix/core-lib-azure-3.0.1

# Explicit compatibility fallback to OSDU community images
spi up --env dev1 --image-source community --image-branch master
```

See [Ingress modes](docs/architecture.md#ingress-profiles) and
[Deployment lifecycle](docs/design/deployment-lifecycle.md) for the complete behavior.
New environments default to public `yuchen-osdu` `main-snapshot` service images,
resolved atomically to immutable digests before provisioning.

## Onboard a Service Repository

Initialize the service repository and complete its `.spi/service.yaml` descriptor first.
The Stack profile must already contain the service Deployment, because onboarding reads the
live Deployment and container names rather than creating workload manifests.

From a Stack checkout, onboard and run the first canary verification with one command:

```bash
uv run spi onboard --repo yuchen-osdu/partition --env auto2 --verify
```

`--env auto2` derives the AKS cluster, AKS resource group, and identity resource group as
`spi-stack-auto2`. The command reads the descriptor from the target repository's `main`
branch, discovers the gateway, Key Vault, Storage account, partition, and Entitlements
domain from the live Stack, then reconciles identity, federation, RBAC, Entitlements, and
environment-owned GitHub Actions settings. Explicit `--service`, `--aks-cluster`,
`--aks-rg`, `--identities-rg`, `--keyvault`, and `--gateway-url` values override discovery.

Verification is opt-in. `--verify` requires descriptor schema version 2, freezes the Flux
GitRepository, Kustomizations, and HelmReleases, runs the target repository's Validation
workflow with `force_full_pipeline=true`, marks `DEPLOY_VALIDATED=true` only after success,
then runs Settings Apply. The cluster remains frozen for CI mode. A failure leaves
`DEPLOY_VALIDATED=false`. The command grants Key Vault access when a vault exists, but
does not require or populate test secret values.

Use `--dry-run` to inspect the plan without changing Azure, Kubernetes, GitHub, or the local
kubeconfig. Re-running against another environment re-homes the repository and resets
`DEPLOY_VALIDATED=false` before optional verification.

## Common Commands

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `spi check` | Validate deployment prerequisites |
| `spi up` | Provision Azure resources and activate GitOps |
| `spi status` | Show deployment health and reconciliation progress |
| `spi info` | Show cluster endpoints and optional credentials |
| `spi reconcile` | Suspend, resume, or refresh Flux reconciliation |
| `spi service` | Pin services to merge-request pipeline images |
| `spi onboard` | Grant a service-fork repository deploy and test access |
| `spi update` | Check for and install a newer CLI release |
| `spi down` | Delete the environment's Azure resources |

Run `spi --help` or `spi <command> --help` for the complete command reference.
